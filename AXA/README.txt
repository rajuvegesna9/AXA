Framework: BDD(Behaviour Driven Development) Framework using Page Object design pattern and Page Factory annotations.  

Instructions: 
Run TestRunner.java file using JUnit Framework.

Analysis:
•	Issues and/or challenges you came across and how did you overcome them:
I came across issues like Cookie Alerts, Web Elements are not properly defined in the HTML code and the Web Elements are not getting  identified sometimes.
I managed to identify Web Elements using several Selenium locators

•	What you would do differently if you had more time?
1. I will spend more time to identify Web Elements properly.
2. I will add cucumber reports to show how many tests are passed, failed etc..
3. I will add Apache log4j logging to write the logs to proper log file
4. I will do more validations for all the fields

 •	What other test cases you would automate and why?
 I will write multiple tests for all the positive and negative scenarios like failed login etc...
 
 •	What tools, dependencies or 3rd party frameworks/libs/modules you used and why?
 I developed BDD Framework using Cucumber, Java, Selenium, Junit etc.. to show how the tests are easy to read in plain English.
